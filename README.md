# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
### Introduction
#### Maria is a chief data scientist in a city school system and she is tasked with preparing all the standardized test data for analysis. This will help to inform decisions about a number of issues. Maria asks for your help in this analysis to look at things such as funding and standardized test scores. This will help the school board understand how a number of factors affect the test scores and preformances of the kids in that school.
### Purpose
