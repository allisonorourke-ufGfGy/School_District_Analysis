# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
### Introduction
#### Maria is a chief data scientist in a city school system and she is tasked with preparing all the standardized test data for analysis. This will help to inform decisions about a number of issues. Maria asks for your help in this analysis to look at things such as funding and standardized test scores. This will help the school board understand how a number of factors affect the test scores and preformances of the kids in that school.
### Purpose
#### In the challenge it was discovered that the 9th graders from Thomas High School may have had some corruption with their data. After you and Maria have run the analysis on the school data you are requested to go back through and run the analysis without that data to  make sure that the analysis is cleaned from discrepiences.
## Results
#### How is the district summary affected?
* After taking out the 9th graders that go to Thomas High School (THS) the count of total students went from 39170 to 38709, making a total of the students removed 461. This group makes up about 1.17 % of all the students in the summary but the removal had a large affect on the data. Before the removale of the data the passing math percentage was 78.9% and the passing reading percentage was 81.8%. After the removal of the corrupt data the pasisn math percentage went down to 74.7% and the passing reading went up to 85.6%. The overall passing math and reading combined went from 65.1% to 65.9% so it did not have as much affect on that number
#### How is the school summary affected?
* For THS, the average math and reading scores went from 83.41 to 59.85 and 83.84 to 60.24, respectively, after the removal of the scores for 9th graders. As a result,the % Passing Math and % Passing reading scored for THS went from 93.27% to 66.9% and 93.31% to 69.66%, though the % Overall Passing did not change.
#### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* Before the removal of the corrupt grades, THS was the second highest preforming school in the district. After the removal, THS becomes the lowest rated school.
#### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
* Math and reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
